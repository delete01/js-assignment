        <h2>Difference between Var, Let and Const </h2>
        <h3>Var</h3>
        <h4>Scope of var</h4>
        <p>Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
            The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
            var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.</p>
        <h5>Let's look at the example below to understand </h5>
        <p>Example : </br>
        </br>
            var greeter = 'Hey hello'; </br>
            function newFunction() { </br>
                var hello = 'Hello'; </br>
            }
        </p>
        <p>Here, greeter is globally scoped because it exists outside a function while hello is function scoped. So we cannot access the variable hello outside of a function. So if we do this:</p>
        <p>Example : </br>
        </br>
             var tester = "hey hi";</br>
            function newFunction() { </br>
                var hello = "hello"; </br>
            } </br>
            console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined
        </p>
        <h5>Problem with var</h5>
        <p>Example : </br>
        </br>
            var greeter = "hey hi"; </br>
            var times = 4; </br>

            if (times > 3) { </br>
                 var greeter = "say Hello instead";  </br>
            } </br>
    
            console.log(greeter) // "say Hello instead"
        </br></p>
        <p>
            So, since times > 3 returns true, greeter is redefined  to "say Hello instead". While this is not a problem if you knowingly want greeter to be redefined, it becomes a problem when you do not realize that a variable greeter has already been defined before.
            If you have used greeter in other parts of your code, you might be surprised at the output you might get. This will likely cause a lot of bugs in your code. This is why let and const are necessary.
        </p>

        <h3>Let </h3>
        <p>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. </br>
        <h5>let is block scoped</h5></br>
        A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.</br>
        So a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block. Let me explain this with an example: </br>
        </br>
        let greeting = "say Hi";</br>
        let times = 4; </br>

        if (times > 3) { </br>
        let hello = "say Hello instead"; </br>
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead" </br>
        } </br>
        console.log(hello) // hello is not defined </br>
        </p>
        <p>
        We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are block scoped.</br>
        <h4>let can be updated but not re-declared</h4>
        </br> Just like var,  a variable declared with let can be updated within its scope. Unlike var, a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope. So while this will work:</br>
        let greeting = "say Hi";</br>
        let greeting = "say Hello instead"; // error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared </br>
    </p>
    <p>However, if the same variable is defined in different scopes, there will be no error: </br>
        let greeting = "say Hi"; </br>
        if (true) { </br>
        let greeting = "say Hello instead"; </br>
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead" </br>
        } </br>
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hi" </br>
    </p>
    <p>Why is there no error? This is because both instances are treated as different variables since they have different scopes.
    </br>
        This fact makes let a better choice than var. When using let, you don't have to bother if you have used a name for a variable before as a variable exists only within its scope.
    </br>
        Also, since a variable cannot be declared more than once within a scope, then the problem discussed earlier that occurs with var does not happen.</p>

       <h3> Const</h3>
        <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.
        </p>
        <h4>const declarations are block scoped</h4>
        <p>Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.
        </p>
        <h4>const cannot be updated or re-declared</h4>
        <p>This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const, we can neither do this:
        </p>
            const greeting = "say Hi"; </br>
            greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. </br>
        nor this: 
        </br>
            const greeting = "say Hi"; </br>
            const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared </br>
        <p>Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.
        </p>
        <p>This behavior is somehow different when it comes to objects declared with const. While a const object cannot be updated, the properties of this objects can be updated. Therefore, if we declare a const object as this:
        </p>
            const greeting = { </br>
                message: "say Hi", </br>
                times: 4 </br>
            } </br>
        while we cannot do this: </br>
        
            const greeting = { </br>
                words: "Hello", </br>
                number: "five" </br>
            } // error:  Assignment to constant variable. </br>
        we can do this: </br>
        
            greeting.message = "say Hello instead"; </br>
        <p>This will update the value of greeting.message without returning errors.</p>
